#### Data, code, and files to generate exhibits 

Exhibit 1, 3, Supplementary 1: Requisite code in `python_exhibits.ipynb`. In order to run the code you will need the libraries contained in `requirements.txt`, which you can also use `virtualenv` to install. 

Exhibit 2, 4: Network files are located under `data/`, as well as in `twitter_networks.gephi`. You will need to open or load these files with Gephi (version used was 0.9.1 on MacOS 10.12.6) or another graph software (i.e. Cytoscape, ENet, etc.).
